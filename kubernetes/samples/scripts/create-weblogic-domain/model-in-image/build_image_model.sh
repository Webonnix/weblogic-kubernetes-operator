#  This script uses the WebLogic Image Tool to build a docker image with model in image
#  artifacts. It is based on a base image obtained earlier with build_image_base.sh
#  
#  Assumptions:
#
#    This script should be called by build.sh.  
#    WebLogic Image Tool is downloaded to the current directory and named weblogic-image-tool.zip
#    WebLogic Deploy Tool is downloaded to the current directory and named weblogic-deploy-tooling.zip
#    Model files have been populated into the "./models" directory.
#
#  Required environment variables:
#
#    WORKDIR - working directory for the sample with at least 10g of space
#
#  Optional environment variables:
#
#    WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE, BASE_IMAGE_NAME, BASE_IMAGE_TAG, 
#    MODEL_IMAGE_NAME, MODEL_IMAGE_TYPE, MODEL_IMAGE_BUILD:
#
#      See build_image_init.sh for a description.
